# hello-world
My first repository :D

Hi everyone! My name is Micah and I am a university student who wants to learn more about programming. 
I am following Github's tutorial for beginners and I like how they mention tacos from the moon. 
They say that the tacos from the moon are better than the ones on Earth, I would like to think that they are better
because the moon is made of cheese so the tacos would be filled with out of this world cheesey goodness. 
I would like to try some one day (as long as they are safe for humans).
